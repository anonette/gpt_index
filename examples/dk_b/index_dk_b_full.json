Examples go back\nto the 'predictive analytics' with olive presses in the 6th century BCE, the complaints about the merciless\nwater clock in the 4th century BCE, and Plautus' famous curse of the sundial (Chapter 2). These classic\nloci show how the fantasies of automation and control over time quickly turn into anxieties about bias,\nprecarity, loss of agency, and sovereignty.\n     Dreams and fears of automation emerge with every new instrument and infrastructure. From the\nearly calendars and clocks to today's reputation and scoring systems, predictive AI, or smart contracts\non trustless blockchain ledgers, automation promises a frictionless, evidence-based, and politically\nneutral future and governance. In the present, the control of time and the future even intensified\nthanks to the computer clocks that do not measure but generate the signals and cycles needed to\nsynchronize the data on the computers and networks and, by proxy, all the processes in society.\n     The pervasive control of time through algorithms and associated bureaucratic structures, such as\nstandards, further erodes the experience of time as an agency to discover, decide, disrupt, or negotiate\nthe future with others.

How do matters of public life become rituals and automated\nservices that leave no room for chance, improvisation, but also for agency and action? What are the\nmetaphysical, political, and material conditions under which governance becomes a matter of\nautomation and algorithms?\n     The reflections on algorithmic governance provide some guidance, but they often focus on the\nregulation and ownership of the algorithms and data responsible for the automation (Micheli et al.\n2020; Elkin-Koren 2020; Saurwein, Just and Latzer 2015; Larsson 2018; Shorey and Howard 2016).\nResearch on algorithmic governance often discusses broad epistemological questions of objectivity and\naccuracy, including the social, political, and economic implications of algorithms and data in critical data\nstudies (Boyd and Crawford 2012; Ananny and Crawford 2018; Kitchin 2017), even issues of energy and\nmineral consumption (Crawford 2013; Parikka 2015). These insights will inform our critique, but the\nfocus will remain on uses of the future and time as conditions of automation.

How do we ensure that any immense power over the future and time respects any values\nwe hold dear in our institutions and political processes, such as human rights, the rule of law, the values\nof political pluralism, legitimacy, or accountability?\n     We will discuss these questions by focusing on the relationship between science, technology, and\nsociety as a problem of prototyping (Chapters 3 and 4). The dichotomies of agency and structure, or\naction and knowledge, experiences of time as Chronos and Kairos (timekeeping and timing), will help\nus understand how prototype defines governance. Rather than prototypes that reduce governance to\nbetter automation (Chapter 2), we are interested in prototypes that democratize power over the future\nand time (Chapters 3 and 4). Prototyping has the potential to open the future to public participation\nand define political and technological representation as a matter of practice. We will define prototyping\nthat tries to \"save\" time as a public good and reject the myth of automation and disruptive\ninfrastructures as our modern-day devil's bridges (Chapter 4).\nGenealogy of future making\n     The discussion of time and the future as a problem of prototyping and automation pays homage", "doc_id": "6b390010-34d9-4c25-b07c-785ead4e58bf", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 8, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a281db09-dd04-4586-b217-8fcacc838d96", "node_info": null}, "9": {"text": "of time and the future as a problem of prototyping and automation pays homage to\nSiegfried Zielinski's project of 'time media' and 'time machines'.

Rather than\nexamining the forgotten and neglected futures of the past, we will focus on the dominant instruments\nof time and future control described in Chapter 2 as governance machines. While, as governance\nmachines, prototypes reduce governance to automation, as exploratory tools, they have the potential\nto support public engagement and represent public interests. The prototypes then become a form of\nsocial action through which we can experience our personal and collective power over the future and\ntime.\n     Before science instruments become governance machines embedded in technical standards,\nmarket expectations, and other bureaucratic structures (Sections 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2), they are prototypes\nthat support personal and community commitments.

Before instruments or\nalgorithms become infrastructures owned and regulated by anyone, they are prototypes and\nexplorations that express conflicting ideas, values, and visions for society. At this early, ambiguous, and\nexperimental stage, we need to increase participation and redefine representation. Rather than merely\naligning and embedding values and political goals, or propagating technological futures and educating\nthe public about hegemonic infrastructures, the liminal environments of hackerspaces and sandboxes\nsupport direct public participation and agency.\n     Liminal and exploratory prototyping enables citizens to define their stake in the future and prevent\nexcesses of algorithmic rule and automation.

Together with the ethnography of hackerspaces and liminal\nenvironments in Chapter 3, it positions prototyping as a problem of governance. Disrupted by every\nnew tool and infrastructure that serves monopolies, our societies resign upon politics. They trade the\nuncertainty of social and personal agency for the certainty of cosmology or ontology (Section 2.2)\npromised by science and technology. To prevent politics and governance from abandoning the future\nas a political and social project and a matter of action (or outsourcing it to new machines and\ninfrastructures), we need to rethink the different ways in which prototypes support our agency and\ndefine the future and time as goals of governance.\nTime as a Condition of automation\n     Time is a strategic resource for every infrastructure that promises automation and an algorithmic\nrule.

The purpose of this book is to rethink\nprototyping and design that uses the future and time as a medium of personal and social agency\n(Kairos), rather than reducing it to a resource and part of a cosmology (Chronos).\n     To prevent the loss of agency over the future and time, we must \u2018uncover the dynamic moments...\n[that] revel in heterogeneity\u2019 and \u2018enter into a relationship of tension with various present-day\nmoments, relativize them and render them more decisive\u2019 (Zielinski 2006).

Bacon uses Drebbel\u2019s instruments to\nillustrate the work on the restoration of human powers over the creation defined as a governance\nproject. He calls the actual designers of such instruments charlatans and magicians who do not\nunderstand the true purpose of their inventions, namely God's plan with humanity. Bacon then\nproposes an institution, the Academy of Sciences, that will define \u2018correct\u2019 prototyping in service of the\nteleological and theological goal of creation (Faulkner, 1993; Keller,", "doc_id": "7ab87a0e-272d-4731-a182-efc345395b60", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 120, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a281db09-dd04-4586-b217-8fcacc838d96", "node_info": null}, "121": {"text": "and theological goal of creation (Faulkner, 1993; Keller, 2012; McCarthy, 1995).\n     Bacon accused artisans like Drebbel of being mere tricksters who manipulate the wealthy patrons\nand the public without advancing the one true goal of governance and technology that will lead\nhumanity to fulfill its purpose in the creation. The project of Instauratio reenacts the original conflict in\nThales between the two uses of expert knowledge and time (Chronos and Kairos). Bacon insists that\nprototyping should serve only the goal of restoration, rather than exploring any new values that express\nthe care for the \u2018whole\u2019 (holon) or \u2018open\u2019 future as that which might exist.

The prototypes set the stage for the algorithmic rule and reduce all politics to control over the\nR&D process and innovation.\n     Against this reduction of politics to cosmology and a myth of automation, the forgotten projects\nbring alternative visions of science, technology, and society relations. They resist Bacon\u2019s metaphor of\n\u2018masculine birth\u2019 and governance as a matter of monopoly over the future through restoration\n(Instauratio). Instead of a teleological progress, prototyping of instruments in these projects supports\nexperimental values and new classes of citizens called artisans, mechanics, natural philosophers, or\nalchemists with various ad hoc and open-ended goals.\n     Drebbel's instruments and related projects described in Section 2.4 will show the future as an open\nproject that emphasizes public engagement and experimentation and breaks the divisions between\nscientific, philosophical, and political metaphors.

It bridges the divides between various domains of knowledge\n(engineering, humanities, art, science) and civic virtues (libertarian DIY making and self-reliance versus\npeer culture of collaboration and communitarian values). With direct access to instruments and policy\ndiscussions, citizens gain agency and disperse the asymmetries of power. They actively define their\nfuture by connecting prototyping with governance.\n     Instead of closing the future to predefined projects of innovation or further automation of society,\ncitizens engage with time and the future as open and commons resources.

To capture the ambiguity of prototyping creating\nmonopolies or exploring the open future, we also used Arendt\u2019s division between action (leisure), labor,\nand work (2013). The prototypes express Kairos as a personal and social agency that influences the\nfuture. They bring new discoveries, but also misuses and creative projects. This emphasis on science\nartisans then responds to Arendt\u2019s critique of instruments as a resignation from politics and society and\nrevives Zilsel\u2019s thesis.\n     DIY makers, hackers, and present artisans use prototypes to interact, define, and perform what\nliving together means in the changing sociotechnical milieu.

Although the impact of participatory, low-cost, ad hoc, and grassroots engagements remains\nlow, it still enacts an experimental governance open to various interventions and values.\nIs there a community of virtuous makers?\n     Experimental governance over prototypes that we observed in the liminal environments (Kera,\n2012b, 2012c) illustrates how time as Kairos is the essence of decisions and agency as a means of future\nmaking. Instead of insights into patterns and cycles that define an ideal future as an effect of Chronos,\ntime as Kairos means an opportunity for action. Kairos opposes any hierarchies and teleological\n(mis)uses of time and refuses to reduce politics to ontology, cosmology, transcendental world of ideas,\nor knowledge of cycles and patters (Chronos). The interactions and engagements remain transient and\nopen ended, prone to contradictions, paradoxes, and chance.\n     The early discussions of geek and hacker governance, such as the pioneering work by Gabriella\nColeman (Coleman, 2013) or the ethnographic accounts of Shenzhen geekdom by Silvia Lindtner (S. M.\nLindtner, 2020), capture the ambiguities of these engagements.

The anecdotes about homo faber blindness add something\nimportant to our discussion of Kairos as playful and reflective tinkering and freedom to design the\nfuture. Appius Caecus was accused of disrespecting traditional rites in the temples and conspiring with\n\u2018plebeians\u2019 (corruption) in the senate to seize power and build his legendary road and infrastructure.\nHis infrastructure still defines the imperial power of Rome over the world, as well as the misused\nfinances and lack of good governance that ultimately brought about the fall of Rome. His engineering\nproject destroyed the institutions and communities that made it possible. The anecdote about this blind\n\u2018prototype\u2019 summarizes the problem with all technologies and projects that promise progress but\nsacrifice culture, politics, and social institutions or, in one word, our agency.\n     The great engineering project of the past, Via Appia, named after Appius, was financed by misused\npublic money and ruined the goals of good governance while achieving the imperial ends of the Roman\nRepublic. Although the accusations remain ambiguous, this corruption case still haunts us because it\nshows how innovation (science and technology) often destroys good governance, which fully depends\non personal and social agency.

FCA describes\nthis as an ability to create a \u2018safe space in which businesses can test innovative products, services,\nbusiness models, and delivery mechanisms without immediately incurring all the normal regulatory\nconsequences of engaging in the activity in question\u2019 (Liao, 2020). The narrow definition of success, the\nmarket, reduces the regulatory forces to only two (technology and markets). Instead of solving potential\nconflicts between various stakeholders, it whitewashes or \u2018algowashes\u2019 the service in a \u2018safe space\u2019\nwithout (or with minimal) regulations.\n   ", "doc_id": "2c4fe054-1fe1-4aae-b232-ca6c3ea98476", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 424, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a281db09-dd04-4586-b217-8fcacc838d96", "node_info": null}, "425": {"text": "space\u2019\nwithout (or with minimal) regulations.\n     The emphasis on the market raises the suspicion that a sandbox is not as independent and inclusive\nas we would expect from a policy tool.

Therefore,\nthe exploratory and public sandbox is an environment that makes all four regulatory forces and remains\nopen to experiments, discussion, and negotiation between stakeholders. Instead of insisting on code\nas an absolute law or sacred laws that will curb innovation by blocking a certain code and making it\ncompliant \u2018by design\u2019, the purpose of an exploratory sandbox is to support participation and\nexperiments.

The exploratory sandboxes for emerging technologies,\nsuch as blockchain, AIs, etc. have to function as such trading zones between code and regulation rather\nthan as a safe space for innovation without regulation or a reason to support moratoria stifling any\ninnovation.\n     The crucial role in the trading zones as captured by Peter Galison\u2019s 1997 seminal work, Image and\nLogic: A Material Culture of Microphysics plays what he calls a \u2018contact language\u2019.

Based on this limited experience in\ndesigning such an environment, we argue that governance of public and exploratory sandboxes means\nexperimenting with and contextualizing the decision-making process, rather than insisting on an ideal\nregulation or infrastructure.\n\n\n     The exploratory sandbox as an environment offers a pragmatic and iterative alternative to the\ncurrent", "doc_id": "ccbfb0d5-e41e-4a50-91d0-773b96836ac4", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 439, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a281db09-dd04-4586-b217-8fcacc838d96", "node_info": null}, "440": {"text": "sandbox as an environment offers a pragmatic and iterative alternative to the\ncurrent attempts to embed predefined cultural, social, and legal norms of ethics, values, etc. into design\nspecifications or machine-readable code. \u2018by design\u2019.

Although \u2018absolute authority\u2019 in\nHobbes is a necessary condition for the law to exist, Lock criticizes it as a dangerous precedent that\nmakes the law impossible.

It serves individuals and collectives to engage over new technologies and ideas, rather\nthan predefined goals of social or technological progress or abstract calls to bridge different divides.\n      Surrounded by friends who became my global family, I experienced prototypes as explorations that\nremain open-ended, even transgressive, and easily incorporate art, pop culture, myths. The experience\nof friendship, tinkering, exploration, and literal cooking in various maker and hacker communities\n\n\naround the world led me to the thesis that prototyping is a form of \"doing\" philosophy, creating\ncommunity or governing society that I described as exploratory sandbox. It is a unique experience of\ntime that makes you realize the importance of our agency over the future.\n     The art and citizen science activities initiated by HONF (House of Natural Fiber) and later by\nLifepatch (Citizens Initiative for Arts, Science and Technology), as well as interactions with various\ncollectives around the world, changed my view of how individuals and communities adopt and integrate\nnew technologies and knowledge into their lives and culture. I was inspired by the work of fellow\nresearchers and academics from the Gadjah Mada University, such as Professor Irfan D.

It always remains a work on a community, fostering personal relationships and\nvisions of the world. The flow and processes of prototyping bridge cultural and geopolitical divisions\nand emphasize the unique experience of time as Kairos, leaving the future open to new engagements\nrather than obsessing over outcomes and products. As Yair Reshef, my \"partner in (prototyping) crime\"\nand founder of Tel Aviv Makerspace, once summed up in a 2014 chat: \u2018I tell ppl that in hackerspaces\nwe don\u2019t *start* anything. we are here to fail. gracefully if possible. completed projects tend to become\na showoff. people always look for the product. a goal embodied in an object.

Hackerspace and makerspace demonstrate the opposite:\nTinkering with science and technology was always a way to define our values, negotiate visions, and\nshape a future that meets our needs and desires. The geeks, artists, designers, and academics who\nparticipated in these gatherings combined in unexpected ways their scientific, artistic, and social\npractices, values, and institutions. In Yogyakarta, universities were always connected to local\ncommunities, villages, artists\u2019 organizations, and various other collectives, where they also prototyped\nto strengthen these relationships.\n     The rich cultural traditions as well as the environmental and economic challenges created the\nconditions for unique and radical visions that Prof. Mr\u00e1zek pointed at in that casual remark, which made\nno sense to me back in 2008. We do not have to visit Silicon Valley, NASA, or a Mars colony to\nexperience future communities that are resilient to extreme conditions by embracing new\ntechnologies. Groups of artists, scientists, and farmers around Yogyakarta have been using prototypes\nto study climate change around the Merapi volcano in Java at least since 2012, when the HONF\nFoundation launched its Micro/Macro Nation project. They connected prototypes of ethanol reactors\nthat ferment waste to farm aquaponics systems and collected data from these experiments for an\nartistic performance.", "doc_id": "8df3f5d5-778b-43bc-b593-adb317559131", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 475, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a281db09-dd04-4586-b217-8fcacc838d96", "node_info": null}, "476": {"text": "aquaponics systems and collected data from these experiments for an\nartistic performance.

None of this was part of any official ideology or project but a work of an\nopportunity that expresses the longing for a community and future that is open, radical, and\nexperimental.\n\n\n     Prototyping was always at the heart of these activities that explored the agency over the future. It\ncombined research with community activism, hacktivism, artistic sensibility and visions that made me\nquestion the dichotomies between theory and practice, community and tools (infrastructure), science,\ntechnology, and art. Whether as Hackteria's hacked webcams with a stage for a microscope made by\nIndonesian artisans, or gel electrophoresis chamber made from IKEA Tupperware for modernist food\ndyes, or the optical density and turbidity sensors made from \"tick-tock\" boxes, these tools combined\nesthetic, critical, and philosophical engagements similar to the ones I recognized in the origins of\nscience in the 16th century.\n     While working and living between Indonesia, Switzerland, and Singapore, I engaged with\ninstruments, kits, and projects that served not only scientific education and research, but also as VJing\nand DJing and even science (geek) diplomacy.

The\nprototypes fostered creative appropriations of scientific protocols, open source technologies, but also\nunique collaborations between universities, arts organizations, and local communities, between\nscience and indigenous knowledge, design, and craft.\n     I never expected that Yogyakarta would play such an important role in my identity as a scientist,\ndesigner, and philosopher, but Professor Mr\u00e1zek predicted it. This DIY capital of the world inspired me\nto rethink my own cultural and disciplinary boundaries, even ideas about who family and friendships\nare. I still feel part of my nomadic family, which I formed while prototyping around the world with\nfriends from all continents, cultures, and boundaries. Rudolf Mr\u00e1zek's prophecy is true because it\nexpresses a provocation that is relevant to all of us. Indonesia and other places outside established\ncultural and technological centers, just as forgotten practices in older periods in our own culture, bring\nnew and unexpected connections between social, cultural, and technological practices.\nReferences\nAitken, M., Toreini, E., Carmichael, P., Coopamootoo, K., Elliott, K., & van Moorsel, A.

This implies lawmaking and action, and is synonymous with the idea of the 'whole'. Thales' control over the future also implies nomos (\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), lawmaking and governance, that are trying to achieve something permanent and binding even 'after time'.

Future as matter of care then implies lawmaking and action, and is described as expertise, connoisseurship, and artistic creation. Thales' anecdotes define the origins of Western philosophy as the problem of future and time control through science and technology. Thales exercises his epistemic and political autonomy as knowledge (of Chronos) that controls the future and time in two ways.

This metaphor has been used to describe the social and economic underclass, which faces similar challenges with its loss of agency in an automated world. The victims of automation do not form any politics or future together, and their only option is to be tolerated as guests on tables and platforms. The clock deprived the parasites of control over their own metabolism and needs, and today's parasites are dehumanized data patterns of algorithmic systems.
