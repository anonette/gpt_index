Myth of automation\n1.0 Rituals, Instruments, and Prototypes\n     Algorithms and data in models and ledgers enact an old fantasy of a future governed by rituals that\nbecome instruments, machines, and infrastructures. It is a fantasy of time control and automation that\nwork as a deus ex machina or devil's bridge, offering miracles that turn into curses. Examples go back\nto the 'predictive analytics' with olive presses in the 6th century BCE, the complaints about the merciless\nwater clock in the 4th century BCE, and Plautus' famous curse of the sundial (Chapter 2). These classic\nloci show how the fantasies of automation and control over time quickly turn into anxieties about bias,\nprecarity, loss of agency, and sovereignty.\n     Dreams and fears of automation emerge with every new instrument and infrastructure. From the\nearly calendars and clocks to today's reputation and scoring systems, predictive AI, or smart contracts\non trustless blockchain ledgers, automation promises a frictionless, evidence-based, and politically\nneutral future and governance. In the present, the control of time and the future even intensified\nthanks to the computer clocks that do not measure but generate the signals and cycles needed",

We will discuss this form of control and the ideal of governance as a myth of\n\n\nautomation.

How do matters of public life become rituals and automated\nservices that leave no room for chance, improvisation, but also for agency and action? What are the\nmetaphysical, political, and material conditions under which governance becomes a matter of\nautomation and algorithms?\n     The reflections on algorithmic governance provide some guidance, but they often focus on the\nregulation and ownership of the algorithms and data responsible for the automation (Micheli et al.\n2020; Elkin-Koren 2020; Saurwein, Just and Latzer 2015; Larsson 2018; Shorey and Howard 2016).\nResearch on algorithmic governance often discusses broad epistemological questions of objectivity and\naccuracy, including the social, political, and economic implications of algorithms and data in critical data\nstudies (Boyd and Crawford 2012; Ananny and Crawford",

We define automation as\nthe control of time through rituals and prototypes of machines and infrastructures that close the future\nby imposing some type of teleology with universal and final goals.\n     To discuss the problem of automation in governance, we will combine metaphysical questions of\ntime and agency with political questions of power (Chapter 2). What is good governance in an age of\nprototypes that disrupt and control citizens' public and even private lives, often without clear\nmandates? How do we ensure that any immense power over the future and time respects any values\nwe hold dear in our institutions and political processes, such as human rights, the rule of law, the values\nof political pluralism, legitimacy, or accountability?\n     We will discuss these questions by focusing on the relationship between science, technology, and\nsociety as a problem of prototyping (Chapters 3 and 4).

They show the importance of personal and social\nengagements with the future and time over prototypes that test and explore different views of\ntechnology and society or time as Kairos and Chronos.\n     Governance that uses algorithms, models, and decentralized ledgers reenacts the myth of\nautomation. It is a myth that reduces politics to cosmology and ontology and imposes the rules of\nrituals, (timekeeping) instruments (Sections 2.1 and 2.2), and infrastructures serving",

Over the years, we documented over twenty projects around the\nworld that capture the role of prototyping in mobilizing different social, political, and aesthetic agendas\n(Kera, 2012b, 2012c; Kera et al., 2013; Kera, 2014a). The main insight was that many of the prototypes\nmock and subvert the techno-utopian agendas to create opportunities for personal and communal\nagency over the future.

It bridges the divides between various domains of knowledge\n(engineering, humanities, art, science) and civic virtues (libertarian DIY making and self-reliance versus\npeer culture of collaboration and communitarian values). With direct access to instruments and policy\ndiscussions, citizens gain agency and disperse the asymmetries of power. They actively define their\nfuture by connecting prototyping with governance.\n     Instead of closing the future to predefined projects of innovation or further automation of society,\ncitizens engage with time and the future as open and commons resources.

To capture the ambiguity of prototyping creating\nmonopolies or exploring the open future, we also used Arendt\u2019s division between action (leisure), labor,\nand work (2013). The prototypes express Kairos as a personal and social agency that influences the\nfuture. They bring new discoveries, but also misuses and creative projects.

Originally, the air pump served a radical philosophical agenda\nof atomism and a rather conservative notion of spirits (Schaffer, 1987).

The radical instrument performed\natomism, but it also supported conservative beliefs in spirits, understood as immaterial forces\nexpressing the power of God (Brundtland, 2011; Heilbron, 1989; Shapin & Schaffer, 2011).\n     Simon Schaffer (1987) showed how the new experimental and epistemic practices and methods in\nthe case of the air pump helped to preserve the theological themes of spirits and souls.

Although the impact of participatory, low-cost, ad hoc, and grassroots engagements remains\nlow, it still enacts an experimental governance open to various interventions and values.\nIs there a community of virtuous makers?\n     Experimental governance over prototypes that we observed in the liminal environments (Kera,\n2012b, 2012c) illustrates how time as Kairos is the essence of decisions and agency as a means of future\nmaking. Instead of insights into patterns and cycles that define an ideal future as an effect of Chronos,\ntime as Kairos means an opportunity for action. Kairos opposes any hierarchies and teleological\n(mis)uses of time and refuses to reduce politics to ontology, cosmology, transcendental world of ideas,\nor knowledge of cycles and patters (Chronos). The interactions and engagements remain transient and\nopen ended, prone to contradictions, paradoxes, and chance.\n     The early discussions of geek and hacker governance, such as the pioneering work by Gabriella\nColeman (Coleman, 2013) or the ethnographic accounts of Shenzhen geekdom by Silvia Lindtner (S. M.\nLindtner, 2020), capture the ambiguities of these engagements. While Coleman shows paradoxes as\nintrinsic to open and free software",

We argue that\nthis function of a good metaphor to provide a 'unifying' environment needs to be extended to\nsandboxes as environments that engage the public in not only the design but also the governance of\nemerging infrastructures.\n      Metaphors as unifying \"experiences\" or even \"environments\" play an essential role in the\n\"orientation phase of technology transfer\" (ibid.). Using examples of parallel computing and\ntransputers, Lepp\u00e4l\u00e4 showed how metaphors mobilized the collective efforts of the research\ncommunity. They created a common and coherent understanding of the possibilities and challenges of\ntechnology. By acting like mock-ups and 'proto' types, they inspire members of the research community\nto define the future product: \u2018... especially in the orientation phase of the technology transfer process,\nit is utmost important that a common and coherent understanding of characteristics and possibilities\nof the technology is created.

Instead of insisting on code\nas an absolute law or sacred laws that will curb innovation by blocking a certain code and making it\ncompliant \u2018by design\u2019, the purpose of an exploratory sandbox is to support participation and\nexperiments. As a public environment, it fosters symbiotic relations between code and regulations,\n\n\nplatforms and institutions, issues of technology, and governance. As liminal and hybrid environment, it\noffers pragmatic alternatives to the ex ante or ex post regulations that come too late to catch up with\nscandals or misuses of technology (Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, various Google services).\n     The main difference between the exploratory and regulatory sandbox remains the question of\nvisibility of the four forces shaping the future services and their interactions.

The book proposes sandboxes as liminal environments for experiencing alternatives to automation and algorithmic rules, and rejects any teleology of final causes in history, society, or the universe. It argues that sandboxes support prototypes that embody values of open, pluralistic, and democratic engagements without ultimate goals in history, technology, and politics, including the pursuit of social justice.

The origin story of Western philosophy, the prediction of the olive harvest by Thales of Miletus, is used to show how Chronos became an instrument of governance.

Automation promises efficiency and structure, but robs citizens of their agency over their time, future, and ability to act. The genealogy of automation reveals forgotten and overlooked alternatives that lead to the present engagements with prototypes in the liminal environments and sandboxes. Prototyping governance means rethinking the individual and societal uses of time, as Kairos experienced in discovery and innovation. It means resisting the undemocratic and arbitrary rule of designers and their patrons and insisting on public engagement in the early stages of prototyping. The origin story of western philosophy in the two accounts of Thales by Plato and Aristotle captures the paradox of stargazing leading to a prediction as well as a fall. It connects Thales' knowledge of astronomical cycles and time as Chronos to his free time, which is interpreted as Kairos. Thales' prediction and fall capture the experience of time as Kairos, an opportunity for success and failure, or discovery and leisure. The genealogy of the early instruments will help us rethink the relationship between technology and governance as a problem of control over the future. Thales' anecdotes capture",

With knowledge of the \u2018whole\u2019, Thales crosses the divide between politics and cosmology (or ontology). Rather than introducing a new infrastructure to maintain the monopoly and wealth, knowledge of Chronos mocks the wealth and lineage as values that determine power. In Plato, Thales demonstrates cosmology and ontology (Chronos) that undermine the social and political order in Athens (experience of Kairos). To illustrate the idea of the future as lawmaking (opposed to the control over monopoly and predictions), Plato then uses two surprising metaphors.

Rather than being a reflection of the cosmological order of the universe, the future becomes an act of judgement and decision making that challenges the balance and status quo in society. The origin story of Western philosophy thus predicted politics as automation and algorithmic rule, but it is also a story of stargazing, agency, and the freedom to explore and question everything. The first victims of Chronos' rule are citizens deprived of the freedom to act and forced to obey the rule of an impersonal instrument of time control, the clock. Literary sources describe them as \u2018idle poor\u2019 even if free citizens who have neither income nor work. They are forced to hang out in public places to seduce and entertain wealthy patrons to get a free dinner at their tables. This loitering earned them their name, parasitos.

Examples of monastic orders show how paradigms organize communities beyond the representation of an ideal meaning or regulation. The regulae of monastic orders presents the founder's way of life (forma vitae) as an interpretation of Jesus' life, adapted to the context of the community and the times. Current prototypes in hackerspaces and makerspaces follow the logic of Agamben's regula and monastic orders, demanding performance rather than repetition of knowledge, insights, and know-how. Prototyping in the hackerspaces explores the future beyond the project of Instauration and desiderata.\n\nRenaissance instrument making, represented by Cornelius Drebbel and similar artisans, performs the paradoxical temporality of Agamben's paradigm, exempla, and regulae as that which might exist.

These promises of control over the future and time led to a resignation upon agency as Kairos in personal and public life. Chronos imposes regularity, certainty, and stability from a nonhuman scale as an ideal for society, reducing the society to an epiphenomenon of models, data, and algorithms. To save politics and time as Kairos, the right time and moment for action and decision, we need to rethink the role of prototyping in technology and governance. Prototyping since Thales served two functions in society: reducing politics to cosmology and ontology, and provoking visions for society that challenged existing values and power structures. Cosmological time as Chronos enables predictions, clocks, and governance machines, but we need to experience time as Kairos to challenge the monopolies and teleological ideals of restoration and progress. Future-making and prototyping that embrace Kairos as part of governance and not just technology define the future as a public good that requires the democratization of science and technology.

Open Science Hardware (OSH) is an example of prototyping that connects science, technology, and governance. It not only improves the oversight and public perception of science, but also engages citizens and enables them to create, obtain, study, modify, distribute, use, and share designs in a variety of contexts. Science artisans use prototypes to interact, define, and perform what living together means in the changing sociotechnical milieu. They use tools to define their future while facing various risks and challenges. OSH enables research in informal spaces and in the Global South while supporting non-utilitarian, creative explorations and reflections. The prototypes of instruments support private and public interests and aspirations and enable citizens to regain sovereignty, dignity, and freedom. They become tools of autonomy and freedom, connecting science, art, design, and politics to transform the nature of scientific work and public action.",

It has been used for various projects, such as artistic expression, political and activist projects, basic design explorations, and scenario on future models for crowdfunding science. It challenges the conventional ways in which we think about science, technology, and society, and enables citizens to directly experience and manipulate aspects of nature.

The 'Open Estrogen Project' directly addresses the socio-technical conundrum as a scientific but also artistic and political problem. The workshops and experiments explore the ambiguous status of estrogen in society, but also in our bodies and nature.

It is a future without an ideal subject, community or goal in nature and history, only an effect of explorations, negotiations, and temporary equilibria.

However, the rich details of the Paxos allegory distracted readers from solving the puzzle and helping the Paxos Parliament. The Bitcoin protocol then claimed that algorithmic governance was a superior form of governance, and the idea of governance as an algorithmic and technological 'fix' to social and political problems has led to arbitrary precedents and power imbalances. To prevent the reduction of governance to automation and the closing of the future to one project and rule, Lamport's separation of Chronos and Kairos, algorithms and metaphors, is essential.

Regulatory sandboxes represent an experimental and pragmatic approach to the dilemmas of code and law, integrating two of the regulatory forces defined by Lawrence Lessig (law and technology).

The Lithopy sandbox was created to challenge the democratic deficit in most services that support automated decision-making and to support legitimacy along with efficiency over new infrastructures. The sandbox balances calls for innovation, disruption, and technological change with participation, deliberation, and legitimacy. It addresses structural challenges in the use of algorithms and new services for governance and decision-making, different from the various interventions and frameworks that claim to increase transparency, oversight, accountability, and participation. The main challenge is to reconcile the novelty and efficiency of automated services with democratic values such as separation of powers, political deliberation, or inclusion in decision-making. Public and exploratory sandboxes for iterating on policy and design have the potential to improve trust in public institutions but also technical infrastructure by allowing public representatives and NGOs to experience and identify the preferred form of algorithmic citizenship in near-future scenarios.",

It proposes the use of a hybrid public sandbox to support experimental forms of algorithmic citizenship and create new forms of division of power. The concept of the Leviathan is explored, which is a metaphor for absolute sovereignty and the idea of automations. It is argued that algorithmic governance is a necessary consequence of the Leviathan, and that it amplifies the discussion of whether the Leviathan is an institution that truly protects citizens from chaos or sacrifices them to its evil twin, the Wicker Man. John Locke's critique of absolute sovereignty is also discussed, as well as the idea of resigning upon agency and experience of time as Kairos in order to model governance after the structures we discover or prototype. The book concludes with a discussion of the dangers of automated decision making without human oversight and how to engage with the authority of the code and automated control of the new algorithmic sovereigns.",

The essay proposes an alternative to the absolute victory of the modern state as an algorithmic machine, and suggests multiplying mythical figures through sandboxes. The Lithopy sandbox is an example of a participatory and liminal environment that supports tactical and situated automation, and preserves personal and social agency in algorithm design processes. Prototyping is seen as a matter of participation and empowerment, and a way to democratize future-making and realize that time is a public resource and infrastructure for commons. Science and technology are seen as mundane, accessible, and everyday practices that resist the myth of automation as an ideal for governance. Benjamin's 'One-way street essay' is referenced, and he is seen as advocating a more reflective use of cosmology and metaphysics in science and technology.

This created conditions for unique and radical visions. Prototyping was at the heart of activities that explored the agency over the future, combining research with community activism, hacktivism, artistic sensibility and visions. Tools combined aesthetic, critical, and philosophical engagements, and served scientific education and research, as well as VJing and DJing and even science diplomacy. This created an \"imagined community\" of transglobal and interdisciplinary collaborations that defied all geopolitical and other orders.

Chronos is an abstract structure that eludes any personal or social action, while Kairos expresses opportunity and the personal and social agency and actions of people. The book proposes sandboxes as liminal environments for experiencing alternatives to automation and algorithmic rules, and rejects any teleology of final causes in history, society, or the universe. It argues that sandboxes support prototypes that embody values of open, pluralistic, and democratic engagements without ultimate goals in history, technology, and politics, including the pursuit of social justice.

Prototypes enable unique collaborations and interactions that support the ideal of open future and freedom without guarantees, and directly address the socio-technical conundrum as a scientific but also artistic and political problem.

It discusses the dichotomy between Chronos and Kairos, two concepts of time, and how they are used in governance machines. Chronos is an abstract structure that eludes any personal or social action, while Kairos expresses opportunity and the personal and social agency and actions of people. The book proposes sandboxes as liminal environments for experiencing alternatives to automation and algorithmic rules, and rejects any teleology of final causes in history, society, or the universe. It argues that sandboxes support prototypes that embody values of open, pluralistic, and democratic engagements without ultimate goals in history, technology, and politics, including the pursuit of social justice. It also discusses the dangers of monopolizing the future with every prototype, platform, and infrastructure, and suggests design and policy proposals that emphasize the public uses of space and time.",

In the 16th and 17th centuries, artisans used prototypes to explore new values in society and transform the world, society, and even the body of the artisan. These prototypes made cosmology and ontology part of personal and political projects, emphasizing time as Kairos and an open future. Francis Bacon's 16th-century project of the Instauratio Magna (Great Restoration) extended control over time and the future from instruments and infrastructures to institutions, and reduced all questions of governance to issues of control over the innovation, discovery, and disruption. In contrast, Cornelius Drebbel's \"folly of empiricism\" and Bornitz's transgender body politics used instruments and prototypes to perform the future as open to engagement and radical visions. G. W. Leibniz's \u2018Academy of Sciences\u2019, also described as \u2018Academy of Games and Pleasures\u2019, is a hybrid and complex R&D institution that combines performances and operas with scientific experiments, exhibitions of mechanical toys, various new media, exotic plants, and animal species.

Open Science Hardware (OSH) is an example of prototyping that connects science, technology, and governance, and enables citizens to create, obtain, study, modify, distribute, use, and share designs in a variety of contexts. OpenDrop is a microfluidics prototype developed through a series of workshops in Italy, Finland, and Switzerland, and has been used for various projects, such as artistic expression, political and activist projects, basic design explorations, and scenario on future models for crowdfunding science. OSH prototypes emphasize the pragmatic and emancipatory functions of lowering the costs of science, and bridge the various technological and scientific divides to support education, research and entrepreneurship. Prototypes enable unique collaborations and interactions that support the ideal of open future and freedom without guarantees, and directly address the socio-technical conundrum as a scientific but also artistic and political problem. They also support 'institutional hacks' and collaborations between formal and informal institutions, serious and exploratory projects. Prototyping embraces the value of freedom as vita activa, and connects the interests in science, technology, and governance on equal grounds.",
